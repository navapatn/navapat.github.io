I am a research assistant at USC Information Sciences Institute, where I am advised by [Prof. Mayank Kejriwal](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Kejriwal/Mayank) as part of the [AICS Group]([https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Kejriwal/Mayank](https://aicomplex.github.io/index.html)). I hold a Master's degree from USC Viterbi School of Engineering, Computer Science where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Mohammad Rostami](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Rostami/Mohammad), focusing on Computer Vision and Domain Adaptation. 

My research interests include Generative AI, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), and knowledge representation methods, particularly Knowledge Graphs. I am passionate about utilzing these technologies to build AI systems that are not only high-performing but also robust and trustworthy. Additionally, I am interested in Computational Social Science, particularly in using data science techniques to uncover insights and in designing effective visualizations that convey these complex insights clearly and compellingly.

Prior to this, I was a Senior Data Analyst/Scientist at [Agoda](https://careersatagoda.com/) where I collaborated with business teams to provide data-driven solutions that supported critical business decisions. I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from Chulalongkorn University, where I graduated with a class honor.



Research
======

My research focuses on evaluating and developing systems that utilize language models to perform various tasks. My research goals revolve around three key objectives:

1. **Human-LLM Interaction:** Exploring how humans can effectively leverage LLMs and how, in turn, LLMs can benefit from human knowledge intervention.
2. **Human Intelligence Structures:** Investigating methods to build human intelligence structures, such as Knowledge Graphs and ontologies, to enhance machine learning and language models.
3. **Knowledge Graph Applications:** Applying Knowledge Graphs to language models in areas such as Question Answering, Commonsense Reasoning, and text generation.
